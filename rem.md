The **REM** Command introduces a comment inside a batch script.

## Synopsis ##

    REM comment

Introduces a comment inside a batch script

* **comment** : The comment to be included. This parameter can not contain any 
  special characters that could be interpreted by Dos9 such as []() or **&**.

## Notes ##

This commande is somehow useless, either inside a script or on the command 
prompt. It is highly recommended to use the newer style of comment as 
described in [comments](spec/comments) page.
